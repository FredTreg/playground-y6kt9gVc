# Basic image manipulation

In this playground, you will practice simple image manipulations, without the help of libraries. This article is intended for people curious to know how to do some simple image manipulations, with an educational purpose. For the same reason, the code that is provided isn't optimized. I recommend using a software or a library if you have to do image manipulations.

The source codes are done in Python but if you know how to program in another language, you should be able to understand the codes.
